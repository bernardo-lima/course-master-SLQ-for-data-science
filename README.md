# Course: Master SQL for Data Science

This repository contains the code I used to solve the assigments of the course [Master SQL For Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-sql-for-data-science/) by Imtiaz Ahmad at Udemy. 

All code is my own, and, sometimes, my solution is different than the one from the course. In some instances, I present my and the courseâ€™s solutions to a specific problem and comment on the differences. 
The code for each section of the course is located in a separate file.
